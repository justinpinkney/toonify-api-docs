Make sure you use this guide as your reference for testing the API as the code snippets generated by RapidAPI don't work Info All the examples below use the v0/toonify endpoint for the original Toonify model. We have other models available at different endpoints. The expected parameters etc. are all the identical between the models, so the examples should work simply by changing the url. First steps The following example uses the Python library Requests to send an image file for toonification. If the Accept header is application/json the response will be json, with images base64 encoded. import requests url = \"https://toonify.p.rapidapi.com/v0/toonify\" headers = { \"x-rapidapi-host\" : \"toonify.p.rapidapi.com\" , \"x-rapidapi-key\" : \"KEY_HERE\" , \"accept\" : \"application/json\" , } files = { \"image\" : open ( \"imagefile.jpg\" , \"rb\" )} response = requests . request ( \"POST\" , url , files = files , headers = headers ) print ( response . json ()) will return a json response like this: { \"num_faces\" : 1 , \"b64_encoded_output\" : \"BASE64_IMAGE_HERE\" , \"b64_encoded_aligned\" : \"\" } Note When returning a json response all images are base64 encoded and returned as a string. Here's an example of how to read one of these into a PIL Image in Python: import base64 from io import BytesIO from PIL import Image b64_encoded_output = \"BASE64_IMAGE_HERE\" file_like = BytesIO ( base64 . b64decode ( b64_encoded_output )) image = Image . open ( file_like ) image . show () Returning an image If you want an image directly returned then set the Accept header to image/jpeg . Here is an example using curl for variety. curl -X POST \"https://toonify.p.rapidapi.com/v0/toonify\" -H \"accept: image/jpeg\" -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" -H \"x-rapidapi-host: toonify.p.rapidapi.com\" -H \"x-rapidapi-key: KEY_HERE\" -F \"image=@test.jpg;type=image/jpeg\" Returning aligned image If you want to return the cropped and aligned face as well as the toonified result you can pass a query parameter of return_aligned=True . If the return type is json then the aligned face will be returned base64 encoded in the b64_encoded_aligned field. If the return type is an image then the two images will be horizontally concatenated and returned. import requests url = \"https://toonify.p.rapidapi.com/v0/toonify\" query = { \"face_index\" : 1 , \"return_aligned\" : \"true\" , } headers = { \"x-rapidapi-host\" : \"toonify.p.rapidapi.com\" , \"x-rapidapi-key\" : \"KEY_HERE\" , \"accept\" : \"image/jpeg\" } files = { \"image\" : open ( \"imagefile.jpg\" , \"rb\" )} response = requests . request ( \"POST\" , url , files = files , headers = headers , params = query ) print ( reponse . content ) #will be the jpeg image bytes Next take a look at the various options you have: More Options","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#first-steps","text":"The following example uses the Python library Requests to send an image file for toonification.

There are a few other parameters that the API currently exposes: face_index (default: 0) crop_edges (default: 0) proceed_without_face (default: False) Indexing faces One of the json response fields is num_faces this tells you how many faces were detected in the original image. If there are multiple faces in the image then you can toonify all of them by passing an extra query parameter of face_index . This zero based index controls which detected face will be sent for toonifcation. import requests url = \"https://toonify.p.rapidapi.com/v0/toonify\" query = { \"face_index\" : 1 , # Process the second face in the image } headers = { \"x-rapidapi-host\" : \"toonify.p.rapidapi.com\" , \"x-rapidapi-key\" : \"KEY_HERE\" , \"accept\" : \"application/json\" , } files = { \"image\" : open ( \"imagefile.jpg\" , \"rb\" )} response = requests . request ( \"POST\" , url , files = files , headers = headers , params = query ) print ( response . json ()) Cropping edges The original model processes images at 512x512 pixels. Sometimes these edges are quite low quality, especially if the original image is a tight crop. You can remove these and get a (slightly) faster response time by setting the crop_edges parameter to be greater than 0. Generally 16 is a good value, but multiples of 8 are recommended. Behaviour when no face is found The proceed_without_face parameter controls the behaviour if no face is found. By default if no face is found the API returns an error. If you set proceed_without_face to be True, we will simply resize and process the full original image as is, the quality in this case is likely to not be good. Example with all the options import requests url = \"https://toonify.p.rapidapi.com/v0/toonify\" headers = { \"x-rapidapi-host\" : \"toonify.p.rapidapi.com\" , \"x-rapidapi-key\" : \"KEY_HERE\" , \"accept\" : \"application/json\" , } query = { \"face_index\" : 1 , # Process the second face in the image \"crop_edges\" : 16 , # crop a 16 pixel border from the image \"proceed_without_face\" : True , # Process even when no face is found } files = { \"image\" : open ( \"imagefile.jpg\" , \"rb\" )} response = requests . request ( \"POST\" , url , files = files , headers = headers , params = query ) print ( response . json ()) Next see tips and considerations in using the API.","title":"More options"},{"location":"more-options/#indexing-faces","text":"One of the json response fields is num_faces this tells you how many faces were detected in the original image.
